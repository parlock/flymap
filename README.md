# FlyMap
Flying Map Application for MSFS 2020

Work in progress.  But this will be a Electron JS app that connects to MSFS 2020 via Simconnect.  And will show a map of the world, with airports, etc.   It will show the players plane moving on it.

## TODO

- Implement Simconnect for getting planes position
- Import Airport/Runway data for overlay on openstreetmaps
- Search for airports and charts
- Simbrief integration for flight plan rendering on the map
- More to come!
